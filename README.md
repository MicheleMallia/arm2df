### Introduction
This program allows you to view graphs of mathematical functions in two dimensions, defined by the user, in the real world through the aid of augmented reality. The program exploits the power of the Unity 3D graphics engine and the Kudan AR library for augmented reality. The program was created thanks to the presence of various online tutorials that will be referenced at the end of the description. The aims of the program are not particularly defined, the project is born for pure fun and curiosity.

### Tools used
* Kudan AR
* Unity3D
* ExpressionParser
* LeanTouch

### Minimum requirements
* Any Android device
* Minimum API = 21 (Marshmallow 5.0)
* Maximum API = automatic

### Constants and mathematical functions allowed
* PI
* *e*
* Square root
* Absolute value
* Natural Logarithm
* Floor function
* Ceil function
* Sin
* Cos
* Tan
* Asin
* Acos
* Atan
* Atan2
* Random function
* Common mathematical operatos ( +, -, ^, /, * )

### The x value
The values assumed by the x start from 0 up to the number set in the resolution slider.

### Instruction
1. Press "Formulas" button.
2. Compose the functions to be displayed
3. Press "OK" button to confirm
4. Press "Respawn" to visualize the mathematical graph
5. Press "DEL" to remove the formula and the graph
6. Hit the "Respawn" button every time you move and you want to view the graph
7. If you want, you can take a photo by pressing "Shoot" button (the path of the output file saved is **Internal Storage/Android/com.michele.arm2df/files/Screenshot.png**
8. If you want, you can change the resolution of the line function by scrolling the value in the slider on the right

### Program features
* Horizontal Surface Detection
* Photo Capture
* Scaling the graph (using two fingers)
* Rotate the graph (sliding your finger horizontally)
* Change the line function resolution
